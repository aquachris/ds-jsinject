Design Studio JS injector plugin
================================

A minimal addon to SAP BO Design Studio 1.2 that lets you 
* add a JS source file to be executed after page load 
* add multiple lines of JS code to be executed after page load

Note that this is basically a development experiment. Please use with care.

Thanks to Mike Howles for initiating the code exchange.
